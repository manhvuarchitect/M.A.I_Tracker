# M.A.I Tracker (Home Assistant Custom Component)

**Current Version: 2.0.0**

A powerful Home Assistant integration to track daily fluid intake, manage caffeine half-life, monitor sleep-safe caffeine levels, and calculate heat index. This is a rebuilt and optimized version based on `caffeine_tracker`.

## 🚀 Features in v2.0.0
- **Profile Cloning (Sao chép cấu hình)**: Easily duplicate complex settings (medicines, environment, notification devices) from an existing user when creating a new one!
- **Medicine Tracking**: Schedule up to 10 medicines with reminder times, actionable mobile notifications, and TTS alerts. Includes interaction warnings (e.g. taking iron/antibiotics near caffeine).
- **Dynamic Water Goal**: Automatically increases your daily water goal on hot/humid days based on the Heat Index.
- **BAC Tracking**: Uses the Widmark formula to track Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) and calculate drive-safe time.
- **Advanced Caffeine Tracking**: Uses exponential decay model to track active caffeine in your body.
- **Water Tracking**: Converts drinks (coffee, tea, etc.) into equivalent water intake and tracks against a daily goal.
- **Heat Index Sensor**: Calculates "Feels Like" temperature based on temperature and humidity sensors.
- **Midnight Reset**: Automatically resets your daily water count at midnight while keeping caffeine timeline intact.
